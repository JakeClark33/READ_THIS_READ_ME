  ## Description 
  This project is intended to create a profdessional looking README markdown file for any project that a user may be working on. The user is provided with CLI prompts through NODE that give the user the ability to create a professional looking README every time without forgetting that important information. The user will have the ability to choose a license, click a link in the table of contents to take them to relevant data and even submit contact info including links to their repo's.

  ## Installation Instructions
  To install this project the user need first clone the repository from https://github.com/JakeClark33/READ_THIS_READ_ME.git. Once the repository has been cloned the user can run the (node index.js) command from NODE command line prompt or GitBash. This will begin prompting the user for information to complete the README template.

  ## Languages
  JavaScript,ES6,Node

  ## Usage
  Once the repo has been cloned and the command line prompt has been run, the user will simply have to follow the prompts and answer the questions. If a question is not answered, you will be prompted again to enter information. Once the template is complete your data will be written to the template.md file. The user can then save this file in the directory of their choosing under a name of their choosing, however, REMEMBER, if you are creating multiple README's you will have to clear the data out of the template.md file and save it as an empty file. Failure to do this will result in the new information you enter being appended to the old information.
